# About

Gossie is (for now) a Go library with a low level wrapper for the Cassandra 1.0 thrift bidings with with utilities for connection pooling, primitive type marshalling and easy query building (much easier to use than the generated thrift bindings). A higher level layer will be implemented on top of the current code to allow for struct marshalling into rows and composites, among other things.


# Requeriments

The official Apache Thrift libraries for Go are outdated and buggy. For now the active development happens in thrift4go:
https://github.com/pomack/thrift4go

Install from the tip of master, make inside thrift4go/lib/go for installing the Thrift Go library.

Once Go 1.0 is released the author will submit a new version of the Go Thrift libraries/generator to Apache.


# Installing

There is no need to generate a Cassandra biding, I am providing one with Gossie (and the whole point is not to have to use it!)

I am using godag, a "go command"-like wrapper for compiling/linking/etc so there is no Makefile in Gossie. I do not plan on providing one.

Gossie is written in Go r60.3 for now. I am waiting for the official Go 1.0 release to port it.


# Running the tests

Launch a Cassandra instance in localhost:9160, create a keyspace named TestGossie, and execute the provided schema-test.txt to create the test column families. Now you can run the Gossie tests.


# Example

I will provide a full example once the higher level marshalling is implemented. For examples of the low level layer check src/gossie/query_test.go
